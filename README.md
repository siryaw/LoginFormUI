## Description

A Neomorphism effect is a mixture of the current famous flat UI and the old skeuomorphic principles. It has dark and light box-shadows on the bottom and top; this combination creates the effect of the elements pushing themselves through your display in a 3D fashion. Created for design purposes only.
